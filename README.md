### I created this repo because I wanted to try and visualize the spread of COVID-19 in the state of FL. Hopefully someone else might find it interesting or useful.

### I get the data from press releases from the FL Department of Health (http://www.floridahealth.gov/diseases-and-conditions/COVID-19/)

### I use plotly b/c the first link I clicked on in the Google search results was related to plotly and b/c I clicked on it, Google from then on decided I only wanted to see plotly pages...

### Plotly requires FIPS codes to work with state and county level data. I got the FIPS codes for all 67 counties in FL from the US Census (https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/2016/demo/popest/2016-fips.html)
